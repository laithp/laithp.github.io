I am going to be working on a number of different projects to expand my working knowledge of various technolgies. They will be highlighted here.

<ul>
    <li><em>This site</em> - <br/>
    This is going to be a somewhat perpetual work in progress. Currently, I'm using it to play around with:
    <ul>
    <li>GitHub Pages</li>
    <li>Jekyll</li>
    <li>Liquid</li>
    <li>CSS/Sass - flexbox</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><em><a href="/blog.html">Dev Blog</a></em> - <br/>
   I will regularly update my progress on various projects and thoughts on tech-related issues I have learned about.
    </li>
    <li><em>Coding Challenges</em> - <br/>
    I am going to be working on a number of John Crickett's Coding Challenges. I will write about them in my Dev Blog, and what I have (completed or not) will be posted in a GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/laithp/coding-challenges" target="_new">https://github.com/laithp/coding-challenges</a>
    </li>
    <li><em>Advent of Code</em> - <br/>
    I will be occasionally working through the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/" target="_new">Advent of Code</a> challenges. My repo for this is <a href="https://github.com/laithp/adventofcode" target="_new">https://github.com/laithp/adventofcode</a>.
