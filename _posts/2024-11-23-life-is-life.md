So, paying work and general life events have gotten in the way of my getting much done here. 

My near future is as follows:
- Over the next few days, I plan to get started on a project of some sort or another (*still deciding which one*). 
- I think I will try my hand at [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/), once the challenges drop on December 1.
- I will make sure to post something here at least once per week (Saturdays?), for accountability.

Anyway, work calls gtg.
