I have continued onwards with the [2023 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), I completed Day 2 part 2 and have started to work on Day 3.

Conceptually day 3 is a much more complicated problem, so it is going to take a bit to figure out how to solve it. I'm sure there is a simple and elegant solution, but I haven't figured it out yet.

With the holiday upcoming and my older children coming home from college for it, the amount of time I can invest is probably going to be less for a few days.
