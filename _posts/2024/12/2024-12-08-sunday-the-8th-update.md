Ok, I completed the first part of Day 2 however after working on the needed revisions for part two I figured that a bit of refactoring of part 1 would make the changes easier to implement. 

So I worked on that for a bit, but the rest of the week got busy in my off time. As a result I'm just getting back to things today.
I have completed the refactor and I am continuing on, I have limited time again this week so we will see how far I get.

I will be committing my work as I go to my [Advent of Code repo](https://github.com/laithp/adventofcode).
