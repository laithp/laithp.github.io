Yesterday, I completed the basic version of Day 1 puzzle one for the [2024 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I got started on the second puzzle, but ran out of free time as it was a busy Sunday. Today is looking better for finishing Day 1 and hopefully completing both parts of Day 2.

I will be committing my work as I go to my [Advent of Code repo](https://github.com/laithp/adventofcode).
