As I expected, with family home and work, I didn't get much more done on the [2023 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Today is the first of December so the new 2024 problem set should be posted. I will be shifting over to that for now.

Additionally, I am thinking about playing around with some different tools that look interesting for rapid cross platform development. I will write about them (positives and negatives) as I work with them.

I hope everyone's December goes well.
