Life has been a bit busy since my last post. However, things should be beginning to settle down, so I can get back to things.

I have worked on what personal project I would like to work on. I am probably going to begin putting together a simple to-do list application. I plan to build it out using multiple stacks, each talking to a common datastore to highlight the flexibility of my skills.
