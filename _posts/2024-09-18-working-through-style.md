Yesterday, I started off by deciding to back out the template I was playing around with. I think that at the moment, working through direct CSS and learning some of the newer features out there is a good path to go on for this.

Later I may swing back around to using a stock template, but if I want to do more front-end styling I will need to improve my handling of CSS first. 

The look and feel of this site will definiately be a work in progress, as I will be playing around with things as I go.
