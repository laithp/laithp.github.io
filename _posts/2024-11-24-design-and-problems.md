Yesterday I worked on changing up the navigation to use flexbox for its layout control. I plan on applying this to the rest of the template, then work on making it responsive. Just not right now.

I also began to work my way through the [2023 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems. I completed #1 and got #2a almost working (I fixed the issue in about 30 seconds when I picked it up today). I have made my [Advent of Code repo](https://github.com/laithp/adventofcode) public, I am focusing on working solutions in php right now, not fully best practice reusable code styling.
