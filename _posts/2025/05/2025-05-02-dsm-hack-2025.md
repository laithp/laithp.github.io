This weekend I am participating in this year's <a href="https://dsmhack.org/" target="_new" ><em>dsm{}Hack</em> charity hackathon</a>.

Starting last evening at 6pm, we will spend 48 hours building a production ready project for one of several local non-profit organizations. Presenting our finished work at 6pm Saturday evening.

I am on the team creating an updated registration system for <a href="https://www.blastbacktoschool.org/" target="_new">"Blast Back To School"</a>, an organization that provides school supplies for students in Story County, Iowa.

It is going to be good working on a project with a team and getting some good work done.
